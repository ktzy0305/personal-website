> I'm grateful for those who've been by my side when I was going through a difficult time in my life and this blog post encapsulates the advice and each and every single one of you have given me which I've found helpful!

Learning to let go is one of the toughest lessons life has in store for us. We all have our own visions of how we want things to unfold, but reality does not always align with our ideals. Cirumstances and luck can throw unexpected challenges along our way, preventing us from attaining what we desire. The aftermath of unmet expectations often leaves us feeling upset and in need of time to process our emotions. Personally, I've found solace in taking the time and space to reflect, allowing myself to gather the strength needed to move forward.

These lyrics from Passenger's "Let Her Go" encapsulate the essence of the journey to let go. Dreams, much like wine in a glass, come and go with swiftness and sometimes catches us off guard. Finding balance, acknowledging the transient nature of life's moments, and appreciating the beauty in the process can help with the process of letting go.

# Opening Up

One of the valuable lessons I've learned on the journey of letting go is to be brave in sharing your emotions and struggles with family and friends. It's human nature to want to keep our emotions, memories, and stories close to our chests, especially when they carry a weight of embarrassment or vulnerability. However, embracing the discomfort and opening up to others can be a profound step towards healing.

As an introvert, the idea of sharing my innermost thoughts and feelings seems daunting to me at first. There exists the fear being judged which creates a barrier from expressing my true self. However, I've discovered that embracing vulnerability has made me feel more genuine and connected. When we share our genuine selves, people are more likely to perceive us as real and relatable, fostering a deeper sense of connection. Furthermore, we are providing a window into our world, enabling others to offer perspectives that we might not have considered. Those who care about us can offer a compassionate ear and a different viewpoint. Sometimes, their insights can serve as a guiding light, helping us navigate the complexities of our emotions or situations. Start small, with trusted friends or family, and gradually expand your comfort zone.

Introverts are often stereotyped as reserved or distant, but opening up defies these expectations. By expressing our thoughts, we challenge misconceptions and show that introversion is not synonymous with emotional distance. It's about letting others in on our inner world, sharing our unique perspectives, and creating a more nuanced understanding of who we are. Opening up, especially as an introvert, is not a sign of weakness; it's an act of courage. It takes strength to step out of our comfort zones and share our authentic selves. In doing so, we not only gain a sense of liberation but also create opportunities for genuine connections with others.

# Time and Healing

This profound advice from a dear friend resonates deeply with the intricate relationship between time, healing, and the choices we make. While time is a constant companion on our journey, its ability to mend wounds isn't as straightforward as the ticking of the clock. As she wisely pointed out, time doesn't possess a magical ability to heal everything. It merely moves forward, indifferent to the emotional scars we carry.

These words echo an undeniable fact: dwelling on the past can intensify the pain rather than alleviate it.

## The Choice to Move On

I wholeheartedly agree with my good friend's sentiments, emphasizing that if given the choice, most of us wouldn't willingly prolong our suffering. The desire to move on, to find solace and embrace the present, is a universal longing. Yet, it's often easier said than done. Memories, like unexpected visitors, can enter our minds without warning, reopening wounds we thought were healing.

# Being Genuine

Ulitimately, I believe that the people who genuinely appreciate you for who you are will more likely be standing alongside you, weathering the storms and celebrating your successes. As you navigate the intricacies of time and healing, it becomes evident that not all connections are meant to stay. Some are transient, serving a purpose for a specific season of life. However, it is crucial to realise that appreciation is a two-way street. Just as you value those who appreciate you, reciprocating that sentiment is equally important. Cultivating a culture of mutual respect, understanding, and acceptance creates a space where authentic connections can flourish.
