# Love

I struggle with love. It is an emotion that is complex to me but simple to others. This year was the first time I experienced love and it wasn't as straightforward as I hoped. I wasn't expecting love to disappoint me time and time again, toying with my emotions and affecting me mentally.
Love has its beautiful and nasty side. Being on her good side brings immense joy and happiness. The feeling of being loved and cared for is very comforting and fulfilling. At other times you are thrown into the deep end and you feel so defeated because the many compromises you made were useless; the efforts you've made gone to waste.

# Eight

"eight" by IU perfectly describes how love can be sometimes. When things are going well, love is as beautiful as an angel. But when things suddenly take a turn for the worst, relationships can end abruptly as people can come and go as they wish. It is dissapointing because love created wonderful memories that will remain forever in our hearts.

Here is an exerpt from the lyrics of "eight".

- So are you happy now?
- Finally happy now? Yeah
- 뭐 그대로야 난 (Well I'm just the same)
- 다 잃어버린 것 같아 (I feel like I lost everything)
- 모든 게 맘대로 왔다가 인사도 없이 떠나 (Everything comes and goes as they wish, even without a goodbye)
- 이대로는 무엇도 사랑하고 싶지 않아 (If this is how things are, I don't want to love anyone again)
- 다 해질 대로 해져버린 기억 속을 여행해 (I'm just going to take a trip down my old memory lane)
- 우리는 오렌지 태양 아래 (Under the orange sun)
- 그림자 없이 함께 춤을 춰 (We danced together when there are no shadows)
- 정해진 이별 따위는 없어 (There is no promised breakup)
- 아름다웠던 그 기억에서 만나 (See you in my memory that is beautiful)
- Forever young
