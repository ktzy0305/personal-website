# Overview
> I wish I could turn back time and diagnosed it earlier.

This post is about my ongoing battle against cancer as a family. From being delivered the unfortunate news and going through the emotional struggles, to finding solace in giving back to the society and discovering superfoods that have anti-cancer properties. This journey is an ongoing one and it has been rather tough. 

# Backstory
Right before the COVID-19 pandemic, my mom was given the unfortunate news that she was diagnosed with Lung Cancer and it had metasized to other parts of her body. My dad and I were distraught as we didn't knew how to break the news to our relatives. We received various words of sympathy from friends and relatives, which I am very thankful for their support during that initial period where I was still trying to accept the reality of the situation.

Then the pandemic hit and the lockdowns began, the economy almost grinded to a halt, layoffs took place and my dad happened to be a victim of one. Despite the string of bad luck we had, it is fortunate that Singapore has numerous social safety nets in place to allieviate the financial challenges we had. Within a span of 3 months, my dad found another job and I was enlisted into the army to begin my National Service.

# The Fight Back
> Together we stand, togther we fight!

In our concerted effort to combat cancer, my family has undergone significant lifestyle changes aimed at fostering a healthier and more resilient environment. 

The first change we have made is eliminated processed and potentially harmful foods from our diet. Examples include canned goods, processed meats, and instant noodles. Instead, we've embraced a diet rich in nutrient-dense options, opting for brown rice, reducing overall carbohydrate intake, and substantially increasing our consumption of fresh fruits and vegetables.

Secondly, we have recognized the importance of being physically active to maintain good health. My mom wasn't particularly keen into exercising. However, with encouragement we convinced her go for a stroll in the neighbourhood park and contribute to her physical wellbeing. As for myself, I'll run at least twice a week except during busy periods of the semester as well as do some calisthenics at home.

# Takeaways
- Against all odds and despite all obstacles, we are going to make it!
- Always give your uptmost best even though the odds are against you.
